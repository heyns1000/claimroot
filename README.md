# 🌐 ClaimRoot: Decentralized Governance & Receipt Engine

**ClaimRoot** is the governance and licensing core of the [NEXUS_NAIR](https://github.com/heyns1000/nexus-nair) ecosystem — a validator-driven, full-stack platform for managing claims, receipts, proposals, and brand governance at planetary scale.

ClaimRoot is built on the 5-layer **FCU Stack™**, integrating blockchain-backed receipts, multi-sig validator voting, heatmap analytics, and encrypted messaging overlays — all unified under the **VaultLevel 7** architecture and visualized through the **HSOMNI9000 Icon Matrix**.
